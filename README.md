# Talk Notes Composed
This project contains the necessary to build and run the combination between the [TalkNotesBack](https://github.com/sebug/TalkNotesBack) and [TalkNotesFront](https://github.com/sebug/TalkNotesFront) projects.

I am using docker-compose 1.14 which I download with the terraform apply.

The whole thing is very inspired by [Build and run your first Docker Windows Server Container](https://blog.docker.com/2016/09/build-your-first-docker-windows-server-container/)
